# Deprecated
This extension version has been deprecated. Version from v3 and upwards is a full rewrite that is still hosted on GitHub, but is no longer open-source. 
The reason is not harmful by any means. I simply decided that open source is not the best choice, moving forward, where the extension will be offering some Pro features that would require upgrade. Extension is still going to be 100% free with all of the features that it had + more. But some features that are for more advanced use and are harder to develop and maintain are going to require a Pro upgrade.

Public repository for discussion/issues and suggestions is available under the following link:
[UW Pub](https://github.com/dvlden/uw-pub)

### Getting started

Select one of the possible options to install this extension, depending on your browser's engine.

1. [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ultrawideo/bfbnagnphiehemkdgmmficmjfddgfhpl)
2. [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ultrawideo/)

> **Note for Opera browser users**: They allow installing extensions directly from the Chrome Web Store, but you must install this extension - [Install Chrome Extensions](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/) to do that. I strongly suggest installing the extension this way because Opera add-ons' approval is insanely slow, and I delisted the extension from there.

> **Note for Microsoft Edge browser users**: Visit the Chrome Web Store and install this extension from there.

### Introduction
The only extension on the market with two significant functionalities that no other extension in this category possess.

- Works on all video streaming platforms. ✅
- Works on all embedded videos. ✅

It doesn't matter if there are multiple direct or embedded video players on a single page. The extension is smart enough to manipulate the video you put into a fullscreen, without affecting other video players.

If you are using multiple browsers on the same or different devices, this extension is cross-browser and will work in all major browsers *(except Safari)*. I tested it in *Chrome*, *Firefox*, *Edge*, *Brave*, *Whale*, and *Opera*; without a single issue.
Many other browsers use *Webkit engine*, hence this extension will work in those browsers too.

<br>

### Should you use it?
It's for everyone who wants power over the video aspect ratio. This extension is primarily for UltraWide monitors, but that does not mean it's only good for it.  You can manipulate the video's size that contains horizontal or vertical black bars and let the video fill your entire screen for a better experience.

<br>

### How to use it?
The extension is relatively easy to use but very powerful at what it does. It has a couple of options:

- **Pause the extension** - *It will stop listening for all memory consuming events and restore any DOM manipulations.*
- **Toggle between modes** - *Toggle between different options will affect the video: normal, upscale, and stretch.*
- **Configurable shortcuts** - *Set desired keystroke, with min/max of 3 keys to control pause or mode toggling.*

<br>

### Works everywhere?
It is working on all **globally popular** video streaming platforms. Making a list of all platforms would be very expensive and time-consuming since many platforms are subscription based.

<br>

### Where it really shines?
Just for a reference, if you come across any videos like the one below, it will be the best watching experience on ultrawide screens. On my screen 3440x1440, using **upscale** mode, it doesn't crop a single pixel of video content. **It's just made to be.**
